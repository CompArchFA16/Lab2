- [10/16] Get `posedge` and `negativeedge` signals correctly generated (as per 1st deliverable)
  - [1.5hr] Construct a test bench
  - [20min] Create a test script that
    - Executes test bench
    - Generates wave forms
  - [1hr] Create a circuit diagram with primitives
  - [30min] Determine the maximum length input glitch that will be suppressed by this design for waveform of 10
    - [30min] Needs value and analysis for the report
- [10/17] Create a shift register and complete that deliverable
  - The shift register has 2 modes:
    - 1st mode: serial in, parallel out
    - 2nd mode: parallel in, serial out
  - [1.5hr] Create test bench for the follow sub-tasks
  - 4 sub-tasks:
    - [30min] Serial data in
    - [30min] Parallel data in
    - [30min] Serial data out
    - [30min] Parallel data out
- [10/19] [1hr] Build top-level interface of the shift register with conditioners to counteract the noise
- [1hr] Successfully load the shift register to the ZYBO board
- [10/20] Complete FPGA deliverables
  - [1hr] Design a test plan for shift register on the FPGA
  - [30min] Record the tests on video

(10hr for midpoint)
